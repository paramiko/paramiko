How to get the code
===================

Our primary Git repository is on Github at `paramiko/paramiko`_;
please follow their instructions for cloning to your local system. (If you
intend to submit patches/pull requests, we recommend forking first, then
cloning your fork. Github has excellent documentation for all this.)


How to submit bug reports or new code
=====================================

Please see `this project-agnostic contribution guide
<http://contribution-guide.org>`_ - we follow it explicitly. Again, our code
repository and bug tracker is `on Github`_.

Our changelog is located in ``sites/www/changelog.rst``.
