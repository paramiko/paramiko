    A secure tunnel across an SSH `.Transport`.  A Channel is meant to behave

    Python socket API.

    Because SSH2 has a windowing kind of flow control, if you stop reading data
    from a Channel and its buffer fills up, the server will be unable to send
    you any more data until you read some of it.  (This won't affect other
    channels on the same transport -- all channels on a single transport are
    flow-controlled independently.)  Similarly, if the server isn't reading
    data you send, calls to `send` may block, unless you set a timeout.  This
