    def check_channel_request(self, kind, chanid):
        """
        Determine if a channel request of a given type will be granted, and
        return ``OPEN_SUCCEEDED`` or an error code.  This method is
        called in server mode when the client requests a channel, after
        authentication is complete.

        If you allow channel requests (and an ssh server that didn't would be
        useless), you should also override some of the channel request methods
        below, which are used to determine which services will be allowed on
        a given channel:

            - `check_channel_pty_request`
            - `check_channel_shell_request`
            - `check_channel_subsystem_request`
            - `check_channel_window_change_request`
            - `check_channel_x11_request`
            - `check_channel_forward_agent_request`

        The ``chanid`` parameter is a small number that uniquely identifies the
        channel within a `.Transport`.  A `.Channel` object is not created
        unless this method returns ``OPEN_SUCCEEDED`` -- once a
        `.Channel` object is created, you can call `.Channel.get_id` to
        retrieve the channel ID.

        The return value should either be ``OPEN_SUCCEEDED`` (or
        ``0``) to allow the channel request, or one of the following error
        codes to reject it:

            - ``OPEN_FAILED_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED``
            - ``OPEN_FAILED_CONNECT_FAILED``
            - ``OPEN_FAILED_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_TYPE``
            - ``OPEN_FAILED_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE``

        ``OPEN_FAILED_ADMINISTRATIVELY_PROHIBITED``.
