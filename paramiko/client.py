    A high-level representation of a session with an SSH server.  This class
    wraps `.Transport`, `.Channel`, and `.SFTPClient` to take care of most
    aspects of authenticating and opening channels.  A typical use case is::

        client = SSHClient()
        client.load_system_host_keys()
        client.connect('ssh.example.com')

        Authentication is attempted in the following order of priority:

              - ``key_filename`` may contain OpenSSH public certificate paths
                as well as regular private-key paths; when files ending in
                ``-cert.pub`` are found, they are assumed to match a private
                key, and both components will be loaded. (The private key
                itself does *not* need to be listed in ``key_filename`` for
                this to occur - *just* the certificate.)

            - Any key we can find through an SSH agent
            - Any "id_rsa", "id_dsa" or "id_ecdsa" key discoverable in
              ``~/.ssh/``

              - When OpenSSH-style public certificates exist that match an
                existing such private key (so e.g. one has ``id_rsa`` and
                ``id_rsa-cert.pub``) the certificate will be loaded alongside
                the private key and used for authentication.

            - Plain username/password auth, if a password was given

        If a private key requires a password to unlock it, and a password is
        passed in, that password will be used to attempt to unlock the key.

        :param str hostname: the server to connect to
        :param int port: the server port to connect to

            Used for password authentication; is also used for private key
            decryption if ``passphrase`` is not given.

            argument of the same name.
        :param transport_factory:
            an optional callable which is handed a subset of the constructor
            arguments (primarily those related to the socket, GSS
            functionality, and algorithm selection) and generates a
            `.Transport` instance to be used by this client. Defaults to
            `.Transport.__init__`.

            an optional instance of `.AuthStrategy`, triggering use of this
            newer authentication mechanism instead of SSHClient's legacy auth
