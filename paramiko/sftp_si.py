    This class defines an interface for controlling the behavior of paramiko
    when using the `.SFTPServer` subsystem to provide an SFTP server.

    Methods on this class are called from the SFTP session's thread, so you can
    block as long as necessary without affecting other sessions (even other
    SFTP sessions).  However, raising an exception will usually cause the SFTP
    session to abruptly end, so you will usually want to catch exceptions and
    return an appropriate error code.

    All paths are in string form instead of unicode because not all SFTP
    clients & servers obey the requirement that paths be encoded in UTF-8.

        Open a file on the server and create a handle for future operations

        should be returned.  This handle will be used for future operations
        on the file (read, write, etc).  On failure, an error code such as
        ``SFTP_PERMISSION_DENIED`` should be returned.

        ``flags`` contains the requested mode for opening (read-only,
        write-append, etc) as a bitset of flags from the ``os`` module:

            - ``os.O_RDONLY``
            - ``os.O_WRONLY``

        (One of ``os.O_RDONLY``, ``os.O_WRONLY``, or ``os.O_RDWR`` will always
        be set.)

        The ``attr`` object contains requested attributes of the file if it
        has to be created.  Some or all attribute fields may be missing if
        the client didn't specify them.

        Return a list of files within a given folder.  The ``path`` will use
        posix notation (``"/"`` separates folder names) and may be an absolute
        or relative path.

        The list of files is expected to be a list of `.SFTPAttributes`
        objects, which are similar in structure to the objects returned by
        ``os.stat``.  In addition, each object should have its ``filename``
        field filled in, since this is important to a directory listing and
        not normally present in ``os.stat`` results.  The method
        `.SFTPAttributes.from_stat` will usually do what you want.

        In case of an error, you should return one of the ``SFTP_*`` error
        codes, such as ``SFTP_PERMISSION_DENIED``.

            objects.

            You should normalize the given ``path`` first (see the `os.path`
            module) and check appropriate permissions before returning the list
            of files.  Be careful of malicious clients attempting to use
            relative paths to escape restricted folders, if you're doing a
            direct translation from the SFTP server path to your local

        probably a good idea to implement "move" in this method too, even for
        files that cross disk partition boundaries, if at all possible.

        the obvious security issues: if you're serving files only from a
        specific folder, you probably don't want this method to reveal path
        names outside that folder.
